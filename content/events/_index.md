## CSSC BBQ

### Wednesday 9 October, 12pm-2pm

is when the next BBQ will be held.
- **Where:** Rex Prider Courtyard (near the Computer Science building)
- **What:** we serve sausages and hash browns, which are *free for members!*
    - We also sell drinks for a small fee.

Be sure to look out for our BBQs, they're a great opportunity to have a feed and chat with other CSSC members.
