## CSSC

The Computer Science Students Club (CSSC) runs social, educational and professional events for students in the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Western Australia.
We provide students with opportunities to meet others with a shared interest or course in computer science.

We have a club room in the Computer Science building, near the computer labs.
Feel free to use our clubroom to rest, study and enjoy discounted drinks.
It has a fridge, microwave, gaming consoles and a PC for computer science students to use.

We run events such as sausage sizzles, games nights, laser tag and quiz nights.
